# Linear-Regression-Model-to-Predict-Housing-Prices

## BUSINESS PROBLEM
<br>
A real estate agent wants some help to predict housing prices for regions in the USA. It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.
<br><br>
She has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You say yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!
<br><br>
She gives you some information about a bunch of houses in regions of the United States,it is all in the data set: USA_Housing.csv.
<br><br>
The data contains the following columns:
<br><br>
'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.<br>
'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city<br>
'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city<br>
'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city<br>
'Area Population': Population of city house is located in<br>
